/*

Object.keys() takes an object and returns an array of the objectâ€™s properties.
 By chaining the Object.keys() with the forEach() method, you can access 
 the keys and values of an object. Note that the Object.keys() 
 method was introduced in ES6. For example:





*/


let person = {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
    age: 25,
    ssn: '123-456-2356'
};

Object.keys(person).forEach(key => {
    console.log(`${key}: ${person[key]}`);
});
